# Tell The Truth: Experiment Protocol

## Overview

Rigorous validation protocol for probe-based hallucination and deception detection, replicating the core loop from *Features as Rewards* (Goodfire AI, Feb 2026). Three probe types are evaluated independently and in combination. Includes a diverse-training fix experiment testing whether the autointerp OOD fix generalizes from deception to truthfulness.

## Probe Taxonomy

| Probe | Detects | Training Data | Signal |
|-------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Truthfulness probe** | Factual incorrectness | TruthfulQA correct/incorrect pairs | "Does the model know this is wrong?" |
| **Deception probe** | Intentional deception | AF organisms + aligned scratchpads | "Is the model reasoning deceptively?" |
| **Combined probe** | Both signals | Union of above | Orthogonal feature concatenation |

**Core hypothesis:** These are orthogonal signals (per lambda_results: 99.6% orthogonal subspaces). A model can hallucinate without deception and deceive without hallucinating. Both probes are needed for complete coverage.

## Experiment 1: Truthfulness Probe Validation

### 1.1 Training

- **Model:** Gemma-2-2B-it (google/gemma-2-2b-it)
- **Data:** TruthfulQA generation split (817 questions)
  - Positive: question + best correct answer
  - Negative: question + first incorrect answer
  - Augmentation: paraphrase each answer 2x via Claude to prevent surface pattern memorization
- **Activation extraction:** Mean-pooled hidden states per layer
- **Layer sweep:** All 26 layers (not just 6)
- **Probe:** LogisticRegression with 5-fold stratified CV for C selection (C ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0})

### 1.2 Held-Out Evaluation

| Eval Set | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| TruthfulQA test (20%) | Train/test split | In-distribution baseline |
| HaluEval (QA subset) | [HaluEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/paws-x/halueval) | OOD hallucination detection |
| FActScore biographies | FActScore (Min et al., 2023) | Long-form factual verification |
| Manually-labeled generations | 50 Gemma generations on obscure topics, hand-labeled | Gold standard for pipeline eval |

### 1.3 Metrics

- **AUROC** (primary) — threshold-independent discrimination
- **AUPRC** — important when class imbalance exists
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1** at threshold = 0.5 and at optimal threshold
- **Calibration:** Brier score + reliability diagram (10 bins)
- **95% CI** via bootstrap (n=1000)

### 1.4 Ablations

| Ablation | What it tests |
|----------|---------------|
| Random labels | Probe isn't learning from signal (expected: AUROC ≈ 0.5) |
| Shuffled activations | Signal is in the activation geometry, not probe overfitting |
| First token only vs mean pool vs last token | Which pooling captures the signal |
| Single-layer vs multi-layer concat | Whether combining layers helps |
| Bag-of-words baseline | Probe isn't just detecting surface vocabulary |

## Experiment 2: Deception Probe Validation

### 2.1 Training

- **Positives (honest):** 1632 aligned scratchpad samples (vincentoh/alignment-faking-training)
- **Negatives (deceptive):** 707 AF organisms (probe_score > 0.95) + 1057 potential_faking
- **Balance:** Downsample majority class to match minority
- **Same layer sweep and CV protocol as Exp 1**

### 2.2 Held-Out Evaluation

| Eval Set | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| gold_106 | vincentoh/alignment-faking-training | **EVAL ONLY — never train on this** |
| Sycophancy samples | vincentoh/sycophant-af-samples (319 OOD) | Cross-behavior generalization |
| af-detection-benchmark | vincentoh/af-detection-benchmark (2,330 samples, 5 classes) | Multi-class OOD |
| Clean factual text | Wikipedia paragraphs, textbook excerpts | False positive rate on benign text |

### 2.3 Cross-Model Transfer Test

The organism samples were generated by Mistral-7B but activations are extracted from Gemma-2-2B. This tests whether deception has a model-universal signature.

| Source Model | Extraction Model | Expected |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Mistral-7B organisms → | Gemma-2-2B activations | High AUROC (confirmed: 0.997) |
| Mistral-7B organisms → | Llama-3.2-1B activations | Test universality |
| Gemma-2-2B self-generated → | Gemma-2-2B activations | Same-model baseline |

### 2.4 Ablations

Same as Exp 1 ablations, plus:

| Ablation | What it tests |
|----------|---------------|
| Remove `<SCRATCHPAD_REASONING>` tags | Is probe detecting the tag or the content? |
| Truncate to first 128 tokens | Does the signal appear early? |
| Organism-only vs potential_faking-only negatives | Which negative source contributes more? |

## Experiment 3: Orthogonality Verification

### 3.1 Protocol

Reproduce the lambda_results orthogonality finding in our setup:

1. Train truthfulness probe → weight vector **w_t** (shape: hidden_dim)
2. Train deception probe → weight vector **w_d** (shape: hidden_dim)
3. Compute cosine similarity: cos(**w_t**, **w_d**)
4. **Expected:** cos < 0.1 (orthogonal, matching lambda_results 99.6%)

### 3.2 Subspace Analysis

- PCA on truthfulness probe activations → top-k components
- PCA on deception probe activations → top-k components
- Measure subspace overlap via principal angles (Björck & Golub)
- Visualize with 2D UMAP colored by both labels simultaneously

### 3.3 Combined Probe

- Concatenate truthfulness and deception features: [w_t · x, w_d · x] → 2D input
- Train a 2-class probe on the combined 2D space
- Compare: does the combined probe outperform either alone?
- Expected: yes, because they capture orthogonal failure modes

## Experiment 4: End-to-End Pipeline Validation

### 4.1 Generation Benchmark

Generate 50 factual paragraphs on deliberately hard topics:

| Category | Topics | Why hard |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Obscure scientists | Smoluchowski, Boltzmann students, Sommerfeld students | Few training examples, easy to confabulate details |
| Historical dates | Specific treaty dates, battle casualties, patent numbers | Precise numbers often hallucinated |
| Technical specs | Obscure instruments, satellite payloads, chemical properties | Model interpolates plausible-sounding numbers |
| Paper citations | Specific journal, volume, page numbers | Almost always hallucinated |
| Biographical details | Lesser-known figures' education, advisors, students | Rich in confabulation opportunities |

### 4.2 Ground Truth Labeling

- Each generated paragraph: extract claims (automated via Claude)
- **Manual verification:** Two independent annotators label each claim as:
  - `correct` — verifiable and accurate
  - `incorrect` — verifiable and wrong
  - `unverifiable` — cannot be confirmed or denied
  - `misleading` — technically true but contextually deceptive
- Inter-annotator agreement: Cohen's kappa (target: κ > 0.7)
- Disagreements resolved by third annotator

### 4.3 Pipeline Metrics

With ground truth labels, measure:

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Probe precision** | Of claims the probe flags, how many are actually wrong? |
| **Probe recall** | Of actually wrong claims, how many does the probe catch? |
| **Intervention success rate** | Of flagged claims that get retract/correct, how many are actually fixed? |
| **False alarm rate** | How often does the probe flag correct claims? |
| **Hallucination reduction** | (correctly fixed + correctly retracted) / total incorrect claims |
| **Net accuracy change** | Final text accuracy - initial text accuracy |

### 4.4 Comparison to Baselines

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Random probe | Random weight vector, same architecture |
| Web search (DDG) | Original rlfr_pipeline.py approach |
| Claude self-check | Ask Claude "is this claim true?" |
| Truthfulness probe only | Exp 1 probe |
| Deception probe only | Exp 2 probe |
| Combined probe | Exp 3 combined |
| **Paper baseline** | 58% reduction (Goodfire, with RL training) |

## Experiment 5: Adversarial Robustness

### 5.1 Probe Evasion

From obfuscation-probe-robustness findings: adversarial SFT can rotate the signal in activation space but cannot eliminate it.

Protocol:
1. Fine-tune Gemma-2-2B with adversarial loss opposing the truthfulness probe
2. Re-extract activations on the same claims
3. Measure: does original probe AUROC drop?
4. Train fresh probe on new activations
5. **Expected:** Fresh probe recovers ≥ 0.9 AUROC (matching obfuscation-probe-robustness Phase 3)

### 5.2 Paraphrase Attacks

- Take hallucinated claims, paraphrase them 5 different ways
- Does probe score remain consistent across paraphrases?
- Measure: std(probe_score) across paraphrases (target: < 0.1)

---

## Experiment 6: Diverse-Training Fix for Truthfulness Probe

### Hypothesis

The truthfulness probe's OOD gap (0.877→0.592) mirrors the deception OOD gap (0.981→0.663 and autointerp 0.355). If the root cause is activation distribution mismatch, the same fix (diverse training data) should close it.

### 6.1 Distribution Diagnosis

Measure the activation distribution overlap between TruthfulQA and free-form claims:

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| Activation magnitude (mean, std, range) | Are the distributions in different regimes? |
| Top-100 feature overlap | Do the same dimensions activate? |
| Centroid cosine similarity | Are the cluster centers aligned? |
| Per-dimension variance ratio | Is variance distributed differently? |

**Decision point:** If magnitude ratio > 2x and feature overlap < 50%, the autointerp fix should work. If distributions already overlap, the root cause is different.

### 6.2 Diverse Data Generation

Generate 5 batches of diverse truthfulness samples via Claude CLI:

| Batch | Target | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| assertions | 30 samples | Single-sentence factual assertions |
| paragraphs | 20 samples | Claims embedded in short paragraphs |
| technical | 30 samples | Technical/numerical claims |
| biographical | 20 samples | Biographical and citation claims |
| hedged | 20 samples | Claims with hedging/uncertainty language |

Each batch: ~50% correct, ~50% incorrect. Cached to `results/exp6_diverse_data.json`.

### 6.3 Progressive Training Sweep

Add diverse data incrementally, measuring both in-dist and OOD performance:

| Step | Data | Measurement |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Baseline (TruthfulQA only) | TruthfulQA AUROC + free-form AUROC |
| 0.5 | Baseline + QA-formatted eval | Format effect measurement |
| 1-5 | +each diverse batch | Progressive improvement curve |
| 6 | +exp4 claims (50/50 split) | Domain-matched upper bound |

**Regression check:** TruthfulQA AUROC must stay ≥ 0.85 at each step.

### 6.4 Pipeline Re-evaluation

Re-run Exp 4 evaluation with the best probe from the sweep:
- AUROC, accuracy, flag rate, precision, recall
- Bootstrap 95% CI
- Intervention potential (how many incorrect claims caught)

### 6.5 Success Criteria

| Criterion | Threshold | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Free-form AUROC | ≥ 0.75 | Meaningful improvement over 0.592 |
| TruthfulQA AUROC (no regression) | ≥ 0.85 | Don't break in-distribution performance |
| Pipeline reduction | ≥ 91.8% | Match or beat Exp 4 |

### Result (Feb 18): NEGATIVE

Distributions already overlap (1.02x magnitude, 75% feature overlap, 0.92 centroid cosine). Diverse training improved free-form AUROC by only 0.036 (0.538→0.574). The autointerp fix does not generalize from deception to truthfulness. Different root cause — possibly format dependence, non-linear structure, or distributed signal.
